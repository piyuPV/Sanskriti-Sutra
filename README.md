Art, Culture and Tourism: Bridging art, culture and tourism with tech 
Problem Statement:  Design, develop, and produce a solution on Streamlit that showcases traditional art forms, uncovers cultural experiences offered across the country, and promotes responsible tourism.

Context:  
India's art and culture space is incredibly diverse and rich, encompassing a wide array of traditions and beliefs, influenced by both ancient and modern times, as well as regional, religious and cultural elements. Dive into the heart of India's artistic and cultural heritage with a story that can enrich both the traveller's journey and the preservation of our cultural treasuresâ€”the data-first way! 

Resources:
1. Explore government contributions to improve art, culture and heritage in India, and discover how it is linked with tourism by exploring data on https://www.data.gov.in.
2. Find out seasonalities and trends in tourism to cultural hotspots. Identify areas that are relatively untouched and why they are so.
3. Create a story covering all these aspects through Snowflake and Streamlit.
